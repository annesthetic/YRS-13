            Julie has her life all planned out and ready to achieved everything she dreamt of with her boyfriend "Sam". But suddendy, Sam passed away in a horrible accident which happend while trying to pick up Julie from the airport. Julie blamed herself and began to self-loathe. She called Sam just to hear his voicemail but Sam picked up. 
            It was a miracle and unbelievable. I mean how could a dead person picked up the phone? Turned out Julie and Sam phones were connected to each other but if one didn't pick up, the connection will be lost forever. Julie decided to take the chance to say goodbye to Sam when she wanted to because Sam left the world out of blue.
